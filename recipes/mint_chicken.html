    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup margarine</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>

        In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. 
        Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
        Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. 
        Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, 
        just until the chicken is cooked through. 
        Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
